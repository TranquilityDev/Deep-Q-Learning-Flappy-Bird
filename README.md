# Deep Reinforcement Learning for Flappy Bird

Deep Q Learning algorithm is originally described in [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5602v1.pdf), a paper from NIPS 2013 Deep Learning Workshop from DeepMind.

In this repository, instead of Atari games, we try to play with Flappy Bird. We use an open source JavaScript library [ConvNetJS](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/index.html) to train Deep Learning Models. 

Our implementation follows [Deep Q Learning Demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/rldemo.html)

Our goal is to train a deep neural network with q-learning technique to learn control policy from inputs generated by the game.
Over time, the flappy bird learns to flap or not at a point to avoid as many pipes as possible.
